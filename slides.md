# Masters of Branding

<img class="full" src="pics/017 - mob.png">

# 2001-09-11

- We were working on a big alternate reality game project for
  a brand where you had to find a missing person (the brand's mascot)
- Fake websites with clues, "missing person" posters all over NYC, etc.
- Project canceled (for obvious reasons), couldn't get into our offices for a week, etc.
- Couldn't make payroll and I decided to leave

# Masters of Branding (~2001-2004)

- Friend from Vir2L was one of the founders (was also my roommate at the time)
- CTO title
- Got into Mac OS X and FreeBSD
- First time I ever managed people
- First time speaking at conferences (on RFID, Python, etc.)
- Worked on websites and in-store technology (RFID, kiosks, etc.)
- Got a bit burnt out and quit

# Consulting (~2004-2005)

- Worked on a foreign language phrasebook "app" for iPod
- Contributed a lot to Python support on the Mac

# Mochi Media

- Started in 2005
- Jameson was in SF, I was in NYC
- Hot or Not founders were the first angel investors
- Moved to Maui for the summer as a "compromise"

# MochiBot

- Sort of like Google Analytics for Flash
- Allowed Flash developers to track their content regardless of what website it was hosted on
- Developers loved it, and were able to use it as negotiation leverage
- Was a pretty early "Web 2.0" project, and we built our own tools and open sourced them

# MochiBot Tech (1.0)

- MochiKit (an early JS library, one of the first with comprehensive tests and documentation. Seriously.)
- simplejson (which became the standard json implementation in Python)
- MySQL -> PostgreSQL
- Apache -> Nginx (0.4!)

# MochiBot Scale

- 

# Erlang

# MochiAds

# Google

# VC

# Margaret

# Series B

# CEO

# No Sale

# SNDA

# Orphaned
