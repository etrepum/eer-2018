<aside class="notes">
I grew up in a small town in MD (about 50 km from Washington DC), but was very lucky to start off with an easier path than most to programming. My father worked at IBM and my mom’s father worked at RCA doing electrical engineering and programming. Some of what he did was classified work for NASA and the NSA and I never could get him to tell me too much about that :)

# Games!

<figure><img class="full" src="pics/002 - kings quest.png"></figure>
<aside class="notes">
The real hook to get me into computers was games. One of my early favorites was
the first Kings Quest. That style of adventure game would let you walk about
with the arrow keys, but you needed to read and write sentences to interact,
so at first I needed a bit of help.

# First Computer: PCjr

<figure><img class="full" src="pics/001 - pcjr.gif"></figure>
<aside class="notes">
This was the first computer we had in our house. Back then most computers
came with a BASIC interpreter, this one actually had it on a cartridge.
Some of my first programming experiences was typing in the code from
magazines at the time and hoping I didn't make a mistake.

# BBS era

<aside class="notes">
I really started learning a lot faster when we got a modem and I was able to
connect with other people. The internet wasn't commercially available back then,
but you could dial up to other people's computers, have discussions, play games,
and share files.

The art and creative coding scenes at the time were a huge inspiration to me. They were able to create truly impressive work under the constraints. This is an ANSi drawing made only with text mode characters. Animations and scrolling with this type of art actually depended on how slow modems were at the time.

Hey, are there any internships available<br /> at Bethesda Softworks?
</h2>
<aside class="notes">
As far as I know, Bethesda Softworks never published an opening for an internship, but I met someone on IRC who worked there and she got me an interview. Having a job in the tech industry when I was 16 really gave me a big head start.

<p>One of the first programming projects I was assigned to was building a tech support call tracking system that also had a database of FAQs.</p>
Later on it grew to also take orders, process credit cards, and print shipping labels. I can’t imagine giving such responsibility to a teenager with no training and no code review, but I was very lucky to have the opportunity to learn!

I learned how to do a lot of their IT, migrating email and file sharing from Lotus and Novell to Linux based solutions. I also migrated their web hosting from Solaris to a self-hosted Linux solution (we had a T1 at the time!) and built some pretty ugly web sites.

<aside class="notes">
<p>Not too long after I learned how tremendously underpaid I was for the work I was doing, I decided to quit so I could get another job or focus on school. I packed up all of my stuff and put it in the car.</p>
In the parking lot I ran into someone who worked across the hall at Vir2L, a design firm that was also part of Zenimax, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks. He encouraged me to interview there, and I got the job for twice as much as I was making. Still not exactly competitive, but I was happy to be making that kind of money in high school while living with my parents.

<p>It was much easier to get a 1099-B Visa in the US at the time and Vir2L took advantage of that. I became friends with super talented people from all over the world, and that personal network really helped me establish myself.</p>
Vir2L was a “new media” design firm, which at the time meant that we mostly made websites. We also worked on some CD-ROM projects and web games with Flash and Director.

<aside class="notes">
<p>I had always wanted to live in a big city and New York was top of my list. When one of my Vir2L colleagues left for a firm in NYC and encouraged me to apply, I did. I got the job, nearly doubling my salary again, and ended up quitting university as well (I had only done two semesters at that point).</p>
<p>I really knew leaving Zenimax was the right choice for me when they threatened to sue me if I didn’t finish the project I was working on at the time. I was only 18 years old! It was a silly avoid the cameras stealth game to promote the Big Brother television show in Europe. I did finish it on time.</p>
Coincidentally, again in the parking lot for Zenimax, I discovered that a colleague of mine was also planning to leave Vir2L to move to New York. We ended up becoming roommates for the first two years we were in New York.

<aside class="notes">
<p>We really liked building web games at WDDG, this was a matching game we made for the brand Corn Nuts. It was hard to get paid for this kind of work at the time unless it was commissioned for a brand.</p>
I only ended up spending a little more than a year at WDDG. At the time the whole company was building an alternate reality game for our largest client. It was a scavenger hunt to find the company’s missing mascot, which included hiding clues on fake websites and putting “Missing Person” posters all over New York. Just a few weeks before launch, on September 11th, 2001, there was a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. The office was just close enough to the site that we weren’t allowed to go there for a week. There were real missing person posters. Thousands of people died. Not surprisingly, the client canceled the project, which left WDDG in a bad situation financially. The company survived, but employees would have go to without salary until the next project. I decided to move on.

<p>My roommate at the time was starting a company at the time and needed someone to lead their technology efforts, so I joined as CTO. Not a bad title for a 20 year old!</p>
At Masters of Branding, or “the MOB”, we worked on advertising projects for brands in retail locations and online. We got to build some interesting kiosks and prototype a few RFID projects very early on.

<p>During this time I learned Python (which really refreshing after a few years with Perl!), and started contributing to open source.</p>
While I didn’t have a lot of mentors at work, I did in the open source world. The Python community in particular was very welcoming to me and I learned so much from them.

We managed to make a boxed retail version and it was sold at Apple stores for a time!

You could upload a set of “Notes” XML files to the device that linked to other notes and audio files, so I wrote the software to build those files from spreadsheets and an installer for both Mac and Windows. It was all written in Python and I contributed a lot of the infrastructure back to the Python community.
